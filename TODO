- there don't seem to be any nice canvas libraries for gtk4
  (although I'm quite ignorant on the subject)
  can we write our own dumb canvas handling?
  eg a page is painted in entirety to an in memory cairo buffer
  of some scale __s__, and the view for that page will be taken
  as a rectangular mask based on current UI size (in x/y pixels)
  then we stitch the masked crops together to form the final view
  which we dump to the screen
  so we repaint on a "damaged page" basis (potentially many if
  the current UI view has multiple pages)
  ...
  zooming in/out is done w/ setting __s__
  ...
  does this make any sense?

- want OverloadedRecordDot (requires ghc >= 9.2)
  when will dependencies compile under ghc 9.2??
  can ghc compile the dependencies w/ a different version of
  ghc v main?
